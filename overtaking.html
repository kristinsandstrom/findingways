 		   <p>I had a picture in my mind of telling stories just by people walking. I was very much inspired by the beginning of a theatre piece I saw in Hamburg “ Die Stunde da wir nichts voneinander wussten „ at the Thalia Theater. I am fascinated by telling stories without using words and I like to play with that part of the human brain which always tries to make up stories (like in the game where you try to see figures in clouds or when you observe people in a café and try to guess their relationship).</p>
		
 		  <p>Still in thought about telling stories without words but by various combinations of people I realized on my daily runs that there is a lot of hugging sculptures in and around Reykjavik. By collecting pictures of those sculptures I got reminded of a video I once saw by Yvonne Rainer ”Dreams of Rage” where exactly that happens what I was thinking about: relationships occur by the way people hug and how outsiders react on that.</p>
			
 		 <p>Because of Yvonne Rainers video I was not only interested in what the different ways of hugging says about a relationship but also what the absence of an embrace means or what happens if someone leaves a hug, if someone turns away or faces an other person. I was interested in the gap a person leaves when this person exits an embrace and what happens when a new person joins the situation.</p>
				
 		<p>I was reading a philosophy book about love by Alain Badiou, he talks a lot about encounter, the coincidence of relationships and how an encounter is not an experience but an event and I suppose that these thoughts fit for any kind of relationship. So I started to contrast traffic and the different ways of hugging, keeping in mind the thoughts about the encounters.</p>

		<p>The flow of traffic is predetermined and controlled, but the units that occupy the roads are random and change. In traffic people meet briefly, you only get a glimpse of someone. This anonymity causes the unforgiveness of this interaction and still it needs a lot of trust and communication.
	</p>
	<p>An encounter is not an experience but an event, which is completely non-transparent and becomes only reality through its various consequences inside the real world. For this encounter you can’t prepare. This surprise starts a process, which becomes a world experience. Everything which comes after is a promise to construct a duration, so that the encounter is freed from its coincidence.</p>
